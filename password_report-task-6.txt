Task 6 â€“ Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

Objective:
Create multiple passwords, evaluate their strength using online/offline tools, and summarize findings and best practices.

Steps performed:
1. Generated six test passwords with varying complexity (weak to strong and passphrases).
2. Tested each password using passwordmeter.com and offline zxcvbn (where possible).
3. Recorded scores, feedback, and screenshots for evidence.

Key findings:
- Weak passwords (short, common words) scored poorly and received feedback to add length and symbols.
- Passphrases and long random strings scored much better; passphrases are easier to remember and still strong if long/unique.
- Increasing length has a greater impact on strength than adding single symbols.

Common attacks:
- Brute force, dictionary attacks, rainbow tables, credential stuffing, phishing.

Recommendations:
- Use a password manager, enable MFA, use unique passwords per account, and prefer passphrases of 12+ characters.

Deliverables:
- results.txt (masked results)
- screenshots/ (evidence of password checker results)
- this report (password_report.txt / password_report.pdf)
